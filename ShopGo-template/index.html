            <h2>Our Services</h2>
            <p>The Starting features of the application is as follows. First we have a interface that allows customers to create their own
                Grocery list from the items they need under the list tab. From there a customer can select the store they want to they buy the
                items they selected under the Map page. This will create a map and plan out a route for them and showing them where all the items
                are located. Finally a user can customize their profile prefrences under Profile.
